# Apollo Front End React App

Apollo is an automated stand-up tool that helps teams stay updated without sinking too much time into meetings. Team leaders create topics where they can send out surveys for team members to answer. Team leaders create and select questions based on the priorities at any given time. 

This is the front-end repository for Apollo. The web application was build using React and Redux, and was styled using SASS. The backend API can be found [here](https://github.com/jonush/apollo-backend). This application is deployed with Vercel and the backend is hosted on Heroku.
